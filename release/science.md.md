  The classical theory of gravitation has been revised to find a new relativistic theory of gravitation. Impact for society will be tremendous.

# Introduction {#sec:intro}

Recently, the theory of classical mechanics has been presented by @Newton1730.


# Material and Methods

We make use of the method of *intuition* to invent another theory [see @Einstein1905 and references therein]. Occassionally, formulas were used, too (see e.g., @eq:emc2).


# Results and Discussion

The relativistic theory works much better than the classical theory (compare @sec:intro).
In @Fig:theories some concepts are shown that might or might not our findings.

# Conclusion and Outlook

Relativistic mechanics is probably the best way to describe a new theory of gravitation.
The future will show whether there is any application of our theories. 

\appendix

# Some maths

$$ E = m\cdot c^2\,, $$ {#eq:emc2}

Because people love to see equations.
